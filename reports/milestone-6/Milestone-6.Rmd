# Milestone Description

Increased complexity of the simple model to include data from
Milestone 5. 
Automated testing and validating procedures implemented where possible.
Procedures for multiple models comparison and accounting for uncertainty established.

# Summary of Milestone 4

In Milestone 4, we presented a simple transmission model that made us
of historical case counts, tranmissibility of the pathogen and
geographical characetrisation as a sole means to predict future risk.
The number of cases at a location $j$ at time $t$ is given by the
equation
\[
  I_{j, t} \sim Pois\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} {\left( p_{i \rightarrow j}
  R_{t, i} \sum_{s = 1}^{t}{I_{i, t - s} w_{s}}\right)} \right),
\]

where $R_{t, i}$ is the  reproduction number at location $i$ at time
$t$ and $p_{i \rightarrow j}$ is the probability of moving from location
$i$ to location $j$. The probability of moving between locations is
derived from the relative flow of populations between locations. This
latter quantity is estimated using a population flow model. In the
previous iteration of our work, we had used gravity model. Under this
model, the flow of individuals from area $i$ to area $j$, $\phi_{i
\rightarrow j}$, is proportional
to the product of the populations of the two areas, $N_i$ and $N_j$,
and inversely proportional to the distance between them $d_{i, j}$
raised to some power. That is,
\[  p_{i \rightarrow j} = (1 - p_{stay}^i) r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread},\]

where $p_{stay}^i$ is the probability of staying at location $i$ and
$r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread}$ is the relative risk of spread to a
location $j$ from a focal location $i$. $r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread}$ can
be quantified as 
\[
  r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread} = \frac{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}{\sum_{x}{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}}.
\]

# Changes in Milestone 6
## Workflow
The pre-processing steps for data obrained from HealthMap/ProMed consist of:
1. Restricting the full data set to the locations of interest;
2. For days with multiple alerts, merge the alerts into a single alert;
3. Discard inconsistent data i.e., that which lead to a decreasing
   cumulative counts;
4. Interpolating for dates for which data are missing so that the
   cumulative incidence count is available for every day in the
   interval of interest and retrieve incidence data from interpolated
   cumulative incidence data.

In addition to the above, a step was added to remove outliers from the
data provided using Chebyshev Inequality with sample mean. Figure
shows the HealthMap data for Liberia through each pre-processing step.

## Model training and validation using data from WHO

In the current iteration, the model was trained and validated the data
on cases officially reported to the WHO during the 2013â€“2016 Ebola
outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This dataset was cleaned
and published in [@garske20160308] and it is this cleaned version of
the data that were used in this work. This dataset consists of
incidence reports at ADM2 level. Thus in using it, we were able to better
validate the model. We refer to this dataset as WHO data throughout
the rest of this document.

# Output for Ebola in West Africa
In this section, we provide results from each step in the workflow
described in [Section](#workflow). 

## Incidence data clean-up
Since the WHO data used was a clean version, pre-processing was not
needed. The pre-processing steps are illustrated using data from HealthMap.
