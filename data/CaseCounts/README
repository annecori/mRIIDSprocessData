Questions (with answers from Emily Cohn, 13 Feb 2017):

We have identified 2 types of issues, 
the “cumulative” number of cases sometimes decreases over time —> Emily explained this is because they have reclassified cases differently after a while. Thanks for clarifying, I think we will just need to decide how we deal with this in the model, but shouldn’t be a big problem and doesn’t seem to happen too often.

—> This did not happen often, but it did happen – especially later in the outbreak when they were testing corpses for causes of death

There are conflicting number of cases reported on a given date. —> For instance in the data cut below, for location “Sierra Leone”, on 26 May 2014, I seem to see 4 alerts with conflicting number of suspected and confirmed deaths (see snapshot below)

—> HealthMap functions by scraping the web and bringing in anything related to the infectious disease keywords. This data is then reviewed by human curators who insert case counts and make corrections as necessary. If the article reports totals that are discrepant from previous articles, they are included anyway (sorry for the background info). This is likely the cause for the discrepancies in the case counts you are including below – as they were earlier on in the outbreak. 
  
—> The first article is from a news source called “The Tribune”, the suspected dead had yet to be tested. The third article (2499000) is a Reuters article claiming that five had died in Sierra Leone. The fourth article is from BBC news and reported four confirmed deaths (not just suspected now) and "A local chief in the area told him that there had been 11 suspicious deaths between Thursday and Sunday.”. I hope this provides some context for the cause of the variability. Now, what you should do with it for modeling – I’m not sure. 
Note this also seems to happen with cases, not only deaths (see below for alerts on 30 May 2014)

So I was wondering whether you can give us insights as to where these differences come from? And how do you think we should deal with them? Are some of the numbers/alerts more reliable than others in your opinion? If so how can we identify these? If not, then I guess we will have to investigate statistical ways of dealing with this (e.g. Taking the mean of all alerts on a day, or taking the largest number reported, or taking the number which makes more sense given the past reports…)

—> The same applies for variability in case counts regardless of whether they are deaths or not. We do give extra ‘weight’ to more well-known/reliable sources. But at some points during outbreaks, the situation changes by the hour – and is confounded by delays in laboratory tests. You can tell the source of the alert at the very end of the ‘Headline’ column (see below). What we have generally done while making line-lists, is gone through and taking the case count that makes the most sense given the surrounding days reports and possibly giving extra weight to those from reputable news sources.

One other thing I didn’t mention on the call, can I just check what alerts mean when I have an alert at the country level and one alert at a smaller spatial scale on the same day, does the alert at the country level count case numbers which encompasses the ones reported at the smaller spatial scale? 

—> Yes, generally the country level alerts are for the entire country. So the influenza counts for United States would be the sum total of the influenza cases of all 50 states. If there is a metarow for Guinea and gives a total of 23, and then there is a metarow for Macenta and gives a total of 21 then we know all but two of the cases in Guinea are in Macenta (made up example).
