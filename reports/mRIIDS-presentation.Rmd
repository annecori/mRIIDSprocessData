# Model

$$I_{j, t} \sim Pois\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} {\left( p_{i \rightarrow j}
  R_{t, i} \sum_{s = 1}^{t}{I_{i, t - s} w_{s}}\right)} \right),$$
where
$$R_{t, i} := f(haq_i, R_0, t).$$
$haq_i$ is a measure of health access quality index at a given location.

# Movement between spatial units
$$p_{i \rightarrow j} = (1 - p_{stay}^i)\frac{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}{\sum_{x}{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}}$$
