\title{Compute incidence from data stream 1}
\usage{
get_incid_DS1(dat, spec, disease, case_type = c("SCC", "SC", "CC", "SCD",
  "SD", "CD"), location, merge_rule = c("median"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{dataframe containing data stream 1 to be processed}

\item{spec}{string giving species in which disease incidence will be extracted}

\item{disease}{string specifying disease of interest}

\item{case_type}{string specifying column name from which incidence is extracted; one of "SCC" (suspected and confirmed cases), "SC" (suspected cases), "CC" (confirmed cases), "SCD" (suspected and confirmed deaths), "SD" (suspected deaths), or "CD" (confirmed deaths).}

\item{location}{string specifying location for which incidence will be computed}

\item{merge_rule}{string to specify how merging should be made when duplicated entries exist. At the moment only "median" is supported.}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing incidence and cumulative incidence obtained from merged_dat.
